          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your household income must be at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. For example, a single person can earn up to $1,215 monthly, while a family of four can earn up to $2,515 monthly and still qualify for the program. These limits are updated annually to reflect cost of living changes.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Participation in SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Housing Assistance, or Tribal-specific programs like FDPIR automatically qualifies you. You don't need to prove income separately if you receive any of these benefits - your participation serves as proof of eligibility for a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong>.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Yes, you must provide either a Social Security number or Tribal identification number during the application process. This requirement helps prevent fraud and ensures benefits go to eligible individuals who truly need communication assistance.

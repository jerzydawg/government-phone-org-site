      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Looking for free internet after the Emergency Broadband Benefit ended? The landscape has changed, but options still exist for qualified households seeking affordable connectivity. Understanding what happened to these programs and exploring current alternatives can help you stay connected without breaking your budget.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">The transition from emergency pandemic relief to ongoing assistance programs created confusion for millions of families. However, many internet providers continue offering discounted services, and new state-level programs have emerged to fill gaps left by federal program changes.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: var(--color-primary)">Understanding the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">The Emergency Broadband Benefit provided crucial internet access during the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary program offered monthly discounts up to $50 for internet service and helped millions of families stay connected when remote work and online learning became essential.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Key features of the original program included device discounts, unlimited data options, and simplified application processes. The program successfully demonstrated the need for ongoing internet assistance, leading to the development of longer-term solutions.</p>

    <!-- Transition to ACP Section -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: var(--color-primary)">The Shift to Affordable Connectivity Program</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">When the Emergency Broadband Benefit transitioned to ACP, participants experienced some changes in benefit amounts and eligibility requirements. The ACP maintained similar goals but operated under different funding structures and qualification criteria.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Unfortunately, the ACP also faced funding challenges and eventually exhausted its budget in 2024. This left many households searching for alternative solutions to maintain affordable internet access. The end of ACP created a renewed focus on provider-specific programs and state initiatives.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Despite these federal program changes, the underlying need for affordable internet remains constant. Many families who benefited from these programs continue seeking reliable, low-cost connectivity options through various available channels.</p>

    <!-- Current Options Section -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: var(--color-primary)">Available Free Internet Programs Today</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Several programs continue providing internet assistance even after federal changes. Internet service providers often maintain their own low-income programs, offering significant discounts or free service to qualifying customers. These company-specific programs operate independently of federal funding.</p>

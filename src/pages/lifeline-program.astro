          The Lifeline program helps millions of Americans stay connected by providing a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> and monthly service at zero cost. This federal initiative ensures low-income households can access essential communication services for work, healthcare, and emergency situations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Every month, qualified participants receive completely free wireless service including unlimited calling, texting, and several gigabytes of high-speed internet data. Government Phone providers deliver modern Android smartphones capable of running apps, browsing the web, and handling video calls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Since 1985, this program has evolved from basic landline discounts to offering full smartphone service. Today's Lifeline benefits provide the same connectivity that working families need for job searching, medical appointments, and staying in touch with loved ones.
